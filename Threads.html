  <h2>Threads and Sockets Study Guide</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand the challenges of parallelization w/ regard to shared resources:</strong> Parallelization introduces challenges such as race conditions, deadlocks, and resource contention when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand the mechanics of multithreading:</strong> Multithreading involves executing multiple threads concurrently within a single process. Threads share code, data, and files but have their own call stack and registers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand the producer/consumer problem outlined in Unit 7:</strong> The producer/consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem where one or more threads produce data items and put them into a shared buffer, while other threads consume these items from the buffer. It requires synchronization mechanisms like locks or semaphores to ensure proper coordination between producers and consumers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand the Unit 9 example code:</strong> Unit 9 likely contains example code related to threads and sockets. Understanding this code helps in grasping concepts such as socket programming, thread creation, synchronization, and communication between threads over a network.
