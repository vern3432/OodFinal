      <strong>Understand basic git commands (including checkout, clone, status, diff, merge, branch, and the ones above)</strong>
      <p>
        Basic Git commands include:
        <ul>
          <li>checkout</li>
          <li>clone</li>
          <li>status</li>

    <li>
      <strong>Understand what .gitignore does</strong>
      <p>
        The .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It's useful for excluding files from version control that are generated automatically or contain sensitive information.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Be able to solve basic git problems (merge conflicts)</strong>
      <p>
        Merge conflicts occur when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches. To solve merge conflicts, one needs to manually resolve the differences between the conflicting changes and then commit the resolved changes.
