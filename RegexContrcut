Regular Expressions for Common Scenarios:

1. Phone Number:
Regex: ^(\\(\\d{3}\\)|\\d{3})[-.\\s]?\\d{3}[-.\\s]?\\d{4}$
Explanation:
- ^ asserts the start of the string.
- (\\(\\d{3}\\)|\\d{3}) matches either a three-digit area code within parentheses or without parentheses.
- [-.\\s]? matches an optional hyphen, period, or space.
- \\d{3} matches exactly three digits for the phone number.
- [-.\\s]? matches an optional hyphen, period, or space.
- \\d{4} matches exactly four digits for the phone number.
- $ asserts the end of the string.

2. First Name, Middle Initial, and Last Name:
Regex: ^[A-Z][a-z]+\\s[A-Z]\\.[\\sA-Z][a-z]+$
Explanation:
- ^ asserts the start of the string.
- [A-Z][a-z]+ matches the first name, which starts with an uppercase letter followed by one or more lowercase letters.
- \\s matches a single space.
- [A-Z]\\.[\\sA-Z] matches the middle initial in the format "X.", where X is an uppercase letter, followed by a space.
- [a-z]+ matches the last name, which starts with a lowercase letter followed by one or more lowercase letters.
- $ asserts the end of the string.

3. Complete Sentence:
Regex: ^[A-Z].*?[.!?]$
Explanation:
- ^ asserts the start of the string.
- [A-Z] matches the first character of the sentence as an uppercase letter.
- .*? matches any characters (including newline characters) zero or more times, non-greedily.
- [.!?] matches one of the specified punctuation marks (. ! ?).
- $ asserts the end of the string.



Regular Expressions for Additional Scenarios:

1. Ending in 'ing':
Regex: \\b\\w+ing\\b
Explanation:
- \\b asserts a word boundary to ensure 'ing' is a whole word.
- \\w+ matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, or underscore) before 'ing'.
- ing matches the literal string 'ing'.
- \\b asserts another word boundary.

2. Contain three vowels in a row:
Regex: \\b\\w*[aeiou]{3}\\w*\\b
Explanation:
- \\b asserts a word boundary.
- \\w* matches zero or more word characters before the sequence of three vowels.
- [aeiou]{3} matches any sequence of exactly three vowels (a, e, i, o, or u).
- \\w* matches zero or more word characters after the sequence of three vowels.
- \\b asserts another word boundary.

3. Contain exactly one vowel:
Regex: \\b[^aeiou\\W]*[aeiou][^aeiou\\W]*\\b
Explanation:
- \\b asserts a word boundary.
- [^aeiou\\W]* matches zero or more characters that are not vowels or non-word characters before the vowel.
- [aeiou] matches exactly one vowel.
- [^aeiou\\W]* matches zero or more characters that are not vowels or non-word characters after the vowel.
- \\b asserts another word boundary.

4. Start and end with the same letter:
Regex: ^(\\w)\\w*\\1$
Explanation:
- ^ asserts the start of the string.
- (\\w) captures the first letter in a group.
- \\w* matches zero or more word characters after the first letter.
- \\1 references the captured group (first letter), ensuring the string ends with the same letter.
- $ asserts the end of the string.
