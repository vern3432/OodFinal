  <h2>UML and Design Study Guide</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand (exact) UML syntax:</strong> UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a standardized general-purpose modeling language in the field of software engineering. It consists of various diagrams such as class diagrams, use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc., each with its own syntax and semantics.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand class relationships and how they are used:</strong> Class relationships include inheritance, aggregation, and composition. Inheritance represents an "is-a" relationship, while aggregation and composition represent "has-a" relationships. Aggregation implies a weaker form of ownership compared to composition.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand good design principles:</strong> Good design principles include breaking the problem into an interaction of objects and keeping objects as small as possible. This promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the software system.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Have a basic understanding of the process and purpose of the process outlined in Unit 6:</strong> Unit 6 likely outlines a process related to software design or development. Understanding its purpose and steps helps in creating well-designed and efficient software systems.
