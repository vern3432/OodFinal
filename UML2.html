        <h1>Class Diagram Relationships</h1>
        <p>Class diagrams are essential in object-oriented modeling, illustrating various class diagram relationships and their impact on system design.</p>
        <h2>Relationship Types</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Association:</strong> Represents a general relationship between classes.</li>
            <li><strong>Directed Association:</strong> Depicts a directional relationship with an arrowhead.</li>
            <li><strong>Reflexive Association:</strong> Occurs when a class has multiple functions or responsibilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Multiplicity:</strong> Depicts the cardinality of a class in relation to another.</li>
            <li><strong>Aggregation:</strong> Indicates a part-whole relationship where the contained classes are not strongly dependent on the container's lifecycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Similar to aggregation but emphasizes the dependence of the contained class on the container's lifecycle.</li>
            <li><strong>Inheritance/Generalization:</strong> Represents a parent-child relationship where the child class inherits functionalities from the parent.</li>
            <li><strong>Realization:</strong> Denotes the implementation of functionality defined in one class by another class.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Benefits of Class Diagrams</h2>
        <p>Class diagrams provide a visual representation of the structure and behavior of a system, aiding in design, analysis, and communication among stakeholders.</p>
        <h2>Drawing Class Diagrams</h2>
        <p>Creately offers intuitive tools for creating class diagrams, simplifying the process with logical relationship adjustments and pre-designed templates.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Understanding class diagram relationships is crucial for effective object-oriented modeling. Creately's tools streamline the process, enabling clearer and more efficient system design.</p>
