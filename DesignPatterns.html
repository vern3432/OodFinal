  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand the format/use cases of the following design patterns:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</strong>: Separates the application logic into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller.</li>
        <li><strong>Adapter</strong>: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Bridge</strong>: Separates an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that they can be modified independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Builder</strong>: Constructs complex objects step by step. It allows the construction of different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.</li>
        <li><strong>Decorator</strong>: Allows behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.</li>
        <li><strong>Singleton</strong>: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.</li>
        <li><strong>Factory</strong>: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.</li>
        <li><strong>Lazy Initialization</strong>: Delays the creation of an object or the calculation of a value until the first time it is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterator</strong>: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.</li>
        <li><strong>Null Object</strong>: Provides a way to handle null references transparently by providing a substitute for the null object.</li>
        <li><strong>Object Pool</strong>: Reuses a set of objects rather than creating and destroying them as needed, improving performance and reducing memory overhead.</li>
        <li><strong>Proxy</strong>: Provides a surrogate or placeholder object to control access to another object.</li>
        <li><strong>Template Method</strong>: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
